# NCovid19 Android Application Prototype

An Android Application prototype which provides information on Novel COVID-19 and its spread.


## My first project

My first mini project which I started during the lockdown. This project was implemented for IEEE Bangalore Section's COVID-19 App Development contest.
I didn't win the contest, but it was a fantastic experience and there was so much learning. I got introduced to Android Studio a superb system software to develop Android applications. I even got to learn Java through this project. 
I understood how much it takes to make an app and I respect all the Android App Developers out there!
